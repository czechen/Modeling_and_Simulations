# Modeling_and_Simulations

## Lagrange Points
In this project I will model the Sun-Earth system with a satellite of negligible mass. The main focus will be on numerical integration of the equations of motion and on the location of the Lagrange Points.  

### Tasks

- [x] Co-rotating reference frame
- [ ] Pseudo Potential
- [ ] Better Data-analysis
- [ ] Proper Readme and comments
