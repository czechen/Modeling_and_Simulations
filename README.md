# Modeling_and_Simulations

## Lagrange Points
In this project I will model the Sun-Earth system with a satellite of negligible mass. The main focus will be on numerical integration of the equations of motion and on the location of the Lagrange Points.  

### Tasks
- [ ] Integration of the equations of motion 
- [ ] Create appropriate Classes
- [ ] Create the animation
